    <h4>Description</h4>
<p>This mode is not recommended because it opens the door to various security exploits. If the plain text to be encrypted contains substantial repetitions. it is possible that the cipher text will be broken one block at a time. You can also use block analysis to determine the encryption key. In addition. an active opponent can replace and exchange individual blocks without detection. which allows the blocks to be saved and inserted into the stream at other points without detection. ECB mode will produce the same result for identical blocks. The use of AES in CBC mode with an HMAC is recommended. ensuring integrity and confidentiality. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/ca5358?view=vs-2019</p>
<h4>Likelihood of exploit</h4>
