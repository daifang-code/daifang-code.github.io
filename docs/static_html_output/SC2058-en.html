    <h2>Unknown unaryoperator.</h2>
<h5>Problematic code:</h5>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">[</span> -E <span class="m">42</span> <span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>
<h5>Correct code:</h5>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">[</span> -e <span class="m">42</span> <span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>
<h5>Rationale:</h5>
<p>You are using an unknown unary operator in a <code>test</code> expression. Perhaps it's a typo?</p>
<p>In bash, you can use <code>help test</code> to see a list of supported operators:</p>

<pre><code>  -a FILE        True if file exists.
  -b FILE        True if file is block special.
  -c FILE        True if file is character special.
  -d FILE        True if file is a directory.
  -e FILE        True if file exists.
  -f FILE        True if file exists and is a regular file.
  -g FILE        True if file is set-group-id.
  -h FILE        True if file is a symbolic link.
  -L FILE        True if file is a symbolic link.
  -k FILE        True if file has its `sticky' bit set.
  -p FILE        True if file is a named pipe.
  -r FILE        True if file is readable by you.
  -s FILE        True if file exists and is not empty.
  -S FILE        True if file is a socket.
  -t FD          True if FD is opened on a terminal.
  -u FILE        True if the file is set-user-id.
  -w FILE        True if the file is writable by you.
  -x FILE        True if the file is executable by you.
  -O FILE        True if the file is effectively owned by you.
  -G FILE        True if the file is effectively owned by your group.
  -N FILE        True if the file has been modified since it was last read.

<h5>Exceptions:</h5>
<p>None. If you've tested and verified that the operator works but the latest version of ShellCheck says it's unknown, please <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/issues">submit a bug report</a>.</p>
