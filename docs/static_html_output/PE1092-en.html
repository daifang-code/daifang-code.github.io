    <h4>Description</h4>
<p>When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application.</p>
<h4>Vulnerability and risk</h4>
<p>Bean manipulation will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.</p>
<h4>Likelihood of Exploit</h4>
<p>Medium</p>
<h4>Potential Mitigations</h4>
<p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an &quot;accept known good&quot; input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications.</p>
