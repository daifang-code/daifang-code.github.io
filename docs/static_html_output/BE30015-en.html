    <h4>Description</h4>
<p>A path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) has been detected. This attack aims to access files and directories stored outside the expected directory. The most effective way to avoid cross-file file path vulnerabilities is to avoid passing user-provided input to the file system APIs. Many application functions that do this can be rewritten to provide the same behavior more securely. https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal</p>
<h4>Likelihood of exploit</h4>
