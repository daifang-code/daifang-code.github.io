    <h4>Description</h4>
<p>An attacker exploits weaknesses in input validation on IMAP/SMTP servers to execute commands on the server.</p>
<h4>Vulnerability and risk</h4>
<p>Web-mail servers often sit between the Internet and the IMAP or SMTP mail server. User requests are received by the web-mail servers which then query the back-end mail server for the requested information and return this response to the user. In an IMAP/SMTP command injection attack, mail-server commands are embedded in parts of the request sent to the web-mail server. If the web-mail server fails to adequately sanitize these requests, these commands are then sent to the back-end mail server when it is queried by the web-mail server, where the commands are then executed. This attack can be especially dangerous since administrators may assume that the back-end server is protected against direct Internet access and therefore may not secure it adequately against the execution of malicious commands.</p>
<h4>Likelihood of Exploit</h4>
<p>Medium</p>
<h4>Potential Mitigations</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>All user-controllable input should be validated and filtered for potentially unwanted characters.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Input should be encoded prior to use in commands to make sure command related characters are not treated as part of the command.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Input should be parameterized, or restricted to data sections of a command, thus removing the chance that the input will be treated as part of the command itself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
