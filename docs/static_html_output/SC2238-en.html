    <h2>Redirecting to/from command name instead of file. Did you want pipes/xargs (or quote to ignore)?</h2>
<h5>Problematic code:</h5>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cat file &gt; tr -d <span class="s1">&#39;\r&#39;</span>
cat file &gt; rm
</pre></div>
<h5>Correct code:</h5>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cat file <span class="p">|</span> tr -d <span class="s1">&#39;\r&#39;</span>         <span class="c1"># tr reads stdin</span>
cat file <span class="p">|</span> xargs -d <span class="s1">&#39;\n&#39;</span> rm   <span class="c1"># rm reads arguments</span>
</pre></div>
<h5>Rationale:</h5>
<p>You are using file redirection, but the filename is an unquoted command name. Instead of running the command and feeding data to it, this just writes to a file with the same name.</p>
<p>To run the command and feed data to it, determine how it gets its data:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the command reads from STDIN, simply use a pipe as in the first example.</li>
<li>If the command reads multiple arguments, use a pipe to <code>xargs</code> as in the second example</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <code>xargs</code> has many pitfalls when it comes to spaces and quotes. <code>cat file | xargs rm</code>  will appear to work during testing, but fails for filenames like <code>My File.txt</code> or <code>Can't_Fight_This_Feeling.mp3</code>. The example uses the GNU extension <code>-d '\n'</code> to more safely handle these names.</p>
<h5>Exceptions:</h5>
<p>If you actually did want to write a file named after a command, simply quote the filename to let ShellCheck know you meant it literally and not as a command name. This does not change anything about how the script works:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Write to a file literally named &#39;rm&#39;, does not try to delete anything</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;A potentially dangerous command&quot;</span> &gt; <span class="s2">&quot;rm&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
