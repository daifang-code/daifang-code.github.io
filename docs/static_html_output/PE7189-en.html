    <h4>Description</h4>
<p>Very confusing method names (but perhaps intentional)</p>
<h4>Vulnerability and risk</h4>
<p> The referenced methods have names that differ only by capitalization.
This is very confusing because if the capitalization were
identical then one of the methods would override the other. From the existence of other methods, it
seems that the existence of both of these methods is intentional, but is sure is confusing.
You should try hard to eliminate one of them, unless you are forced to have both due to frozen APIs.

<h4>Likelihood of Exploit</h4>
