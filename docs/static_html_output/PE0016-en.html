    <h4>Description</h4>
<p>When an if statement is prematurely terminated with a semicolon, the then portion which was intended to be conditional will execute unconditionally. When a semicolon prematurely terminates a while or for loop, the loop might iterate infinitely or it might iterate pointlessly, followed by the intended body of the loop that executes once, unconditionally.</p>
<p>A number of heuristics distinguish between extraneous and intentional semicolons. For if statements, if the if has no then and no else clause, it is a defect. The only exception to this behavior is if there is a C/C++ macro that expands to nothing in the location that the then clause is expected. In this case, it is assumed that the macro conditionally expands either to a non-empty statement or nothing.</p>
<p>The rule for loops is more complicated, because loops with no bodies are common. Generally speaking, a while or for loop will only be reported if it is followed by a block (a &quot;compound statement&quot;) that is not justified for any purpose other than serving as the loopâ€™s intended body.</p>
<h4>Vulnerability and risk</h4>
<h5>logic error</h5>
<p>An extraneous semicolon alters the logic of the code. When an if statement is prematurely terminated with a semicolon, the then portion which was intended to be conditional will execute unconditionally. When a semicolon prematurely terminates a while or for loop, the loop might iterate infinitely or it might iterate pointlessly, followed by the intended body of the loop that executes once, unconditionally.</p>
<h4>Likelihood of Exploit</h4>
<p>Medium</p>
<h4>Potential Mitigations</h4>
<p>Look over the semicolon followed by if, for, while statements, remove the stray senicolon.</p>
<h4>Demonstrative Examples</h4>
<h5>Vulnerable Code Example</h5>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">bad</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">){};</span>
    
  <span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// detect</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="k">return</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In the vulnerable code example, a stray semicolon followed by the while statement at line 4.</p>
<h5>Fixed Code Example</h5>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">good</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">){};</span>
    
  <span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="k">return</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In the fixed code example, remove the stray senicolon followed by the while statement at line 4.</p>
