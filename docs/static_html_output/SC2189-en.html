    <h2>You can't have | between this redirection and the command it should apply to.</h2>
<h5>Problematic code:</h5>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt; file.txt <span class="p">|</span> grep foo
</pre></div>
<h5>Correct code:</h5>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt; file.txt grep foo   <span class="c1"># or more canonically: grep foo &lt; file.txt</span>
</pre></div>
<h5>Rationale:</h5>
<p>ShellCheck has found a stage in a pipeline that consists of a redirection but no command. This doesn't make sense because a redirection without a command will not read or write any data.</p>
<p>This is most likely to occur when deleting a command that had a redirection, but leaving a <code>|</code> behind instead of moving the redirection to a different command:</p>

<pre><code># Match lines with line numbers
nl &lt; foo.txt | grep bar

# Incorrect attempt at removing line numbers. grep now has no input:
&lt; foo.txt | grep bar

# Line numbers correctly removed. grep now reads foo.txt as intended.
grep bar &lt; foo.txt
</code></pre>
<h5>Exceptions:</h5>
<p>It's technically valid to do e.g. <code>echo foo | &gt; &quot;$(cat)&quot;</code> to truncate a file called &quot;foo&quot;, but please consider rewriting such code.</p>
