<h5>Problematic code:</h5>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">array</span><span class="o">=(</span> <span class="o">[</span>index<span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> value <span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>
<h5>Correct code:</h5>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">array</span><span class="o">=(</span> <span class="o">[</span>index<span class="o">]=</span>value <span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>
<h5>Rationale:</h5>
<p>The shell doesn't care about the <code>=</code> sign in your array assignment because it's not part of a recognized index assignment. Instead, it's considered a literal character and becomes part of an array element's value.</p>
<p>In the example problematic code, this is because the <code>=</code> was intended to set the index, but the shell will not recognize it when it is surrounded by spaces.</p>
<p>Make sure to remove any spaces around the <code>=</code> when assigning by index, such as in the correct code.</p>
<p>If you wanted the <code>=</code> to be a literal part of the array element, add quotes around it, such as <code>env=( &quot;LC_CTYPE=C&quot; )</code> or <code>specialChars=( &quot;=&quot; &quot;%&quot; &quot;;&quot; )</code> .</p>
<h5>Exceptions:</h5>
<p>None.</p>
