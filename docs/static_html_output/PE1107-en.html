    <h4>Description</h4>
<p>The software generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.</p>
<h4>Vulnerability and risk</h4>
<p>Many hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently.</p>
<h4>Likelihood of Exploit</h4>
<p>Medium</p>
<h4>Potential Mitigations</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Use an adaptive hash function that can be configured to change the amount of computational effort needed to compute the hash.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When using industry-approved techniques, use them correctly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
