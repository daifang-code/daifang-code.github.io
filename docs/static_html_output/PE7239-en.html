    <h4>Description</h4>
<p>Could be refactored into a static inner class</p>
<h4>Vulnerability and risk</h4>
<p> This class is an inner class, but does not use its embedded reference
  to the object which created it except during construction of the
inner object.&nbsp; This reference makes the instances
  of the class larger, and may keep the reference to the creator object
  alive longer than necessary.&nbsp; If possible, the class should be
  made into a <em>static</em> inner class. Since the reference to the
   outer object is required during construction of the inner instance,
   the inner class will need to be refactored so as to
   pass a reference to the outer instance to the constructor
   for the inner class.</p>
<h4>Likelihood of Exploit</h4>
<p>low</p>
