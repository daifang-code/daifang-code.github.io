    <h4>Description</h4>
<p>The software does not properly prevent private data (such as credit card numbers) from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the data or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the people to which the data is related.</p>
<h4>Vulnerability and risk</h4>
<p>Mishandling private information, such as customer passwords or Social Security numbers, can compromise user privacy and is often illegal. An exposure of private information does not necessarily prevent the software from working properly, and in fact it might be intended by the developer, but it can still be undesirable (or explicitly prohibited by law) for the people who are associated with this private information.</p>
<h4>Likelihood of Exploit</h4>
<p>Medium</p>
<h4>Demonstrative Examples</h4>
<h5>Vulnerable Code Example</h5>
<p>This code uses location to determine the user's current US State location.</p>
<p>First the application must declare that it requires the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission in the application's manifest.xml:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">&lt;uses-permission</span> <span class="na">android:name=</span><span class="s">&quot;android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>During execution, a call to getLastLocation() will return a location based on the application's location permissions. In this case the application has permission for the most accurate location possible:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">locationClient</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">LocationClient</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">locationClient</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">connect</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">Location</span> <span class="n">userCurrLocation</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="n">userCurrLocation</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">locationClient</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getLastLocation</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">deriveStateFromCoords</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">userCurrLocation</span><span class="o">);</span>
</pre></div>
<p>While the application needs this information, it does not need to use the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission, as the ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION permission will be sufficient to identify which US state the user is in.</p>
