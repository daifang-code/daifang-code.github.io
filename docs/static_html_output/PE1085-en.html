    <h4>Description</h4>
<p>Formula Injection, also known as CSV Injection, occurs when websites embed untrusted input inside CSV files.</p>
<h4>Vulnerability and risk</h4>
<p>When a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc is used to open a CSV, any cells starting with '=' will be interpreted by the software as a formula. Maliciously crafted formulas can be used for three key attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hijacking the user's computer by exploiting vulnerabilities in the spreadsheet software, such as CVE-2014-3524</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hijacking the user's computer by exploiting the user's tendency to ignore security warnings in spreadsheets that they downloaded from their own website</p>
</li>
<li><p>Exfiltrating contents from the spreadsheet, or other open spreadsheets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Likelihood of Exploit</h4>
<p>Medium</p>
<h4>Potential Mitigations</h4>
<p>This attack is difficult to mitigate, and explicitly disallowed from quite a few bug bounty programs. To remediate it, ensure that no cells begin with any of the following characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equals to (&quot;=&quot;)</li>
<li>Plus (&quot;+&quot;)</li>
<li>Minus (&quot;-&quot;)</li>
<li>At (&quot;@&quot;)</li>
</ul>
