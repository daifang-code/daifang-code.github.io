    <h4>Description</h4>
<p>Call to equals() comparing unrelated class and interface</p>
<h4>Vulnerability and risk</h4>
<p>
This method calls equals(Object) on two references,  one of which is a class
and the other an interface, where neither the class nor any of its
non-abstract subclasses implement the interface.
Therefore, the objects being compared
are unlikely to be members of the same class at runtime
(unless some application classes were not analyzed, or dynamic class
loading can occur at runtime).
According to the contract of equals(),
objects of different
classes should always compare as unequal; therefore, according to the
contract defined by java.lang.Object.equals(Object),
the result of this comparison will always be false at runtime.
</p>
<h4>Likelihood of Exploit</h4>
